## Nova Client 
Nova Client is a client made by me which has many features and its open source which is cool i guess and its uh yea

## Installation 
Download [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/crx/tampermonkey_stable.crx)

## IMP. NOTE!!
I was installing Arch Linux and during that i accidentaly wiped the windows partition that had all the Nova client code in it like idek how i messed up that big i cant even make this shit up and i didnt have it backed up all i have is a old beta that only has fps and ping counter but i dont wanna continue working on that so im gonna start from scratch and try to make it better then it was while i was making it but i also have upcoming exams and i wont be online that much but youll see me sometimes online on discord and you can ask me anything there.
